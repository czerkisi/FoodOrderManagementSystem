# Food Order Management System (FOMS)
## _A Concept Order System_

This program uses I/O to allow business owners to digitize restaurant menus and allows customers to order from this menu

## Features

with their online menu
    &emsp;**Examples of Options:**
    - Would you like fries with your burger?

    - Would you like flour or corn tortillas on your taco?
- The User's responses to each Option can change the price, number of calories and description of the item before it is placed in the cart

- A premade restaurant, Tijuana Cafe, demonstrates how to use Options
